Následující kapitola pak přibližuje a vysvětluje proces výběru soudců {NSS} teoreticky, tedy jsou popsány dvě cesty, které aktuálně na tento soud vedou. Třetí kapitola se zabývá už konkrétně otázkou transparentnosti výběru soudců {NSS}. Ten je pro přehlednost rozdělen do pěti stádií (vzorem je pět stádií, na která teorie rozděluje výběr soudců okresních a krajských soudů) a v rámci každého z těchto stádií je zkoumáno, do jaké míry je v daný okamžik do procesu výběru soudců {NSS} tzv. z vnějšku vidět, tedy do jaké míry je transparentní. Ve čtvrté kapitole jsou pak shrnuty mezery, které se, pokud jde o transparentnost, v procesu výběru soudců {NSS} v jednotlivých stádiích objevují, nastíněny problémy, ke kterými tyto mezery mohou vést, a potenciální změny, které lze ve výběru soudců {NSS} provést.},

	abstract = {The Supreme Court of the United States ({SCOTUS}) issues 10–15 \% of its opinions unsigned, concealing authorship. Traditionally, unveiling authors required the posthumous release of Justices’ personal papers. We trained our {AI} algorithm to achieve real-time authorship probabilistic identification, encompassing 17 Justices and 4,069 opinions from 1994 to 2024. Our algorithm identified the likely authors of the March 2024 Trump v. Anderson case, which enabled Donald Trump to run for office. Moreover, our algorithm unveiled the likely authorship in significant unsigned {COVID}-19 era cases, estimated with high probability individual parts of the joint dissent in the Obamacare Case (2012), and discerned the likely authors of the landmark cases of Bush v. Gore (2000). Applications range from legal research to decoding {SCOTUS} internal dynamics. Compared to prior methods, our study demonstrates a substantially higher accuracy rate of 91 per cent over a much longer period of time, offering timely insights into the nuances of {SCOTUS} decision-making. To facilitate further research, we provide a public web server at https://raminass.github.io/{SCOTUS}\_AI/.},

	abstract = {In pursuing their goals, members of the U.S. Supreme Court are affected by their institutional setting. How has that institutional environment changed over time and what have been the political consequences of those changes? Despite considerable analysis of the institutional dynamics of legislatures and executives, political scientists have been slow to bring time series techniques to the study of the Supreme Court, and as a result much less is known about its evolutionary path. Measuring a variety of organizational characteristics, I construct an index of the institutionalization of the Supreme Court from 1790 to 1996. This indicator suggests that the integration of the Court into the system of federal policy making has better enabled the justices to satisfy their objectives. To demonstrate this empirically, I test a series of error correction models of judicial influence, each of which confirms that the nature of the Supreme Court's character has had considerable implications for the scope of the justices' legal and political impact. These results underscore the need for judicial scholars to examine the Court's policy making in longitudinal perspective.},

	abstract = {This Article discusses supreme and constitutional courts' internal organizational cultures, that is, the way in which justices organize their work and establish informal decision-making norms. Courts of last resort are often presented as exemplary deliberative institutions. The conference meeting, which convenes judges in quiet seclusion to debate, has been glorified as the most significant step in a court's decision-making process. Based in part on qualitative empirical research, I argue, however, that French, American, and European justices may not deliberate in the full sense that deliberative democrats have theorized.The Article distinguishes two types of high court deliberations, which I call the "ex ante" and the "ex post" models. In the first model, prevalent in the French and European courts, judges draft and deliberate the court's merits opinion before the case is orally argued and scheduled for the conference meeting. In other words, cases are decided before being decided. The second model is typical of Anglo- American supreme courts, in particular the United States Supreme Court; in this model, justices do most of the deliberative work after the case has been orally argued and a vote on the merits has taken place at the conference. In other words, cases are decided after being decided.Despite different judicial cultures, one common theme is that in both ex ante and ex post courts, judges tend to decide cases through a succession of multiple small group interactions involving non-judicial personnel rather than a single prolonged face-to-face deliberation. The upshot of the Article is the formulation of a dual-influence hypothesis: a court's style of judicial opinions may form deliberations as much as deliberations shape opinions.},

            This chapter considers the role law clerks play. Law clerks have a legal education and support judges in the adjudicative process, and are often employed to make courts more productive and to help judges concentrate on hard cases. Different forms of clerking can be found in most judicial systems of the world. Law clerks can be young graduates hired for educational purposes, seconded judges assisting higher court judges for a few years, or settling on a long-term clerk career. They may be organized in pools assisting different judges or be assigned to individual judges. Tasks range from doing research and writing memos at first instance, assisting in gatekeeping at higher courts, to being present at oral hearings and deliberations, and to draft complete judgments. The central question is the degree of influence law clerks have. Outside the United States, research on law clerks is still relatively rare and comparative research is still in its early stages. Comparative research on law clerks can provide unique insights into legal careers, courts as organizations, as well as judicial decision-making.},

Law clerks at the {ECJ}, called référendaires, are drawn from the ranks of lawyers, legal academics, legal administrators, and judges. They provide valuable legal and linguistic expertise, ease the workload of their members, participate in oral and written interactions between cabinets, and provide continuity as members rapidly change. Although they have more power than their counterparts in the United States Supreme Court, they are not the puppeteers of the members, but their agents. Focusing on the purported unchecked power of clerks distracts us from examining the important institutional consequences of changes in workload or an expansion of members.},

	abstract = {{AbstractCentral} and Eastern European countries ({CEE}), compared to common law countries but also other civil law countries of Europe, are known for a strikingly high representation of women within judiciaries. This, however, does not mean that equality has been achieved, as women judges do not reach leadership positions at the same rate as their male peers. Taking the Czech Republic as a case study, this contribution explores the barriers women judges face within a {CEE} judiciary and analyses their reflections on their positions. The interviews with women judges show that while they are well aware of what is holding them back, most of them do not perceive the structurally unequal position of men and women in Czech society and in the judiciary as a problem and accept the consequences as being part of women’s destiny. This means that the system currently lacks bottom-up incentives and pressure for change.},

Recent studies have shown that the design of judicial institutions can have important legal, social, and economic consequences for a given polity. Scholars have dwelled on the reasons that lead political actors to the choice of one model of judicial review over another, but there has been little empirical study on this choice. Here, several hypotheses as to the circumstances that lead to the establishment of constitutional courts are tested on the basis of a data set of 128 democratic constitutions.

              Based on an analysis of all administrative court cases published in the Netherlands in 2020 ( 
              N 
              = 4,642), we tested the hypothesis that experienced law clerks write judgments with greater confidence than less experienced clerks. A confidently written judgment was defined as being shorter, less standardized, and containing fewer legal references than a less confidently written judgment. In support of this hypothesis, our results showed that law clerks with more experience co-signed judgments that were less standardized and contained fewer legal references. However, contrary to the confidence hypothesis, we established that these judgments were also longer than judgments co-signed by less experienced clerks. Our study contextualizes the concerns expressed in studies on the {US} Supreme Court about the delegation of drafting duties to inexperienced law clerks. The study challenges the assumption that delegation of drafting duties to law clerks automatically results in judgments with a less confident writing style, due to the clerks’ inexperience. The assumption may hold for the {US} Supreme Court, where all law clerks are relatively inexperienced. However, the assumption does not hold in jurisdictions in which law clerks can be just as experienced (in terms of years worked in the legal field) as judges. This conclusion suggests that research on the functioning of the {US} Supreme Court cannot necessarily be generalized to other jurisdictions.},

            Orders are judicial decisions designed to shore up fair and timely resolution of disputes. As written, detailed, and factual documents, they are reliable markers of procedural steps and a unique source of information about the inner working of an institution. This article examines all published orders of the European Court of Justice, drawing lessons from their use. The analysis demonstrates that the pursuit of efficiency and uniform application blurs the lines between the administration and judging. First, it centralises the institution, expanding the duties of the Registry and amplifying the role of the Cabinet of the President of the Court. Second, it bureaucratises the interpretation and the uniform application of European Union law. These processes are common in judicial institutions with no power over their dockets. But the particular European response, authored by the Court, also suggests its reluctance to forfeit the interpretive monopoly.},

            Law clerks hold immense responsibilities and exert influence over the judges they work with. However, women remain underrepresented in these positions. We argue that one reason for this underrepresentation is that – like potential political candidates – female law students may have lower levels of ambition compared to men. Using a survey of student editors at thirty-three top law reviews, we find that there is a gender gap in ambition for clerkships with the Supreme Court and Federal Courts of Appeal. Examining potential sources of this difference, we find that while women view themselves to be just as qualified for these positions as men, men are more willing to apply with lower feelings of qualification. Likewise, while women and men report similar levels of encouragement, more encouragement is required before women express ambition to hold these posts. The findings presented here have implications for research on judicial politics, political ambition, and women’s representation.},

Several political actors have argued that courts have assumed too much power after the democratic transformation process in 1989/1990. These claims are explicitly or implicitly connected to the charge that courts have constrained the room for manoeuvre of the legislatures too heavily and that they have entered the field of politics. Nevertheless, the question to what extent has this aggregation of power constrained the dominant political actors has never been examined accurately and systematically in the literature. The present volume fills this gap by applying an innovative research methodology to quantify the impact and effect of court's decisions on legislation and legislators, and measure the strength of judicial decisions in six {CEE} countries."},

Dosud však chybí solidní důkaz toho, že jednotliví ústavní soudci k projednávaným věcem přistupují odlišně, a debata o příčinách těchto odlišností je tak nutně neukotvená. Její ukotvení ve výchozím zjištění, že se jednotliví ústavní soudci významně liší v relevantních kvantitativních kritériích, je cílem tohoto článku. V jeho rámci jsou na základě dat pokrývajících všechna konečná rozhodnutí Ústavního soudu vydaná v období od počátku činnosti Ústavního soudu České republiky do 30. 6. 2016 zodpovězeny otázky vztahující se k produktivitě a rychlosti jednotlivých soudců a jejich vstřícnosti vůči navrhovatelům. Heuristikou použitou pro hodnocení soudců dle těchto kritérií je přiřazení výsledku věci, doby jejího projednávání a konečného rozhodnutí v ní toliko jejímu soudci zpravodaji. Kromě žebříčků ústavních soudců dle jednotlivých kritérií (produktivity, rychlosti a vstřícnosti) článek nabízí také otázky, jež umístění jednotlivých ústavních soudců v těchto žebříčcích vyvolává, a podněcuje tak další výzkum.},

	shorttitle = {Judicial Decision-Making, Ideology and the Political},
	abstract = {The present paper puts forward a first  outline of a possible agonistic theory of adjudication, conceived of as an extension of Chantal Mouffe’s agonistic theory of democracy onto the domain of the juridical, and specifically, judicial decision-making. Mouffe’s concept of the political as the dimension of inherent and unalienable conflicts (antagonisms) which, nonetheless, need to be tamed for a pluralist democracy to function, creates an excellent vantage point for a critical theory of adjudication. The paper argues for perceiving all judicial decisions as having a double nature—juridical and political. Cloaked in legal form, judgments nonetheless decide on individual instances of on-going collective conflicts, opposing workers to employers, consumers to traders, tenants to landlords, moral progressives to traditionalists, minorities to majorities and so forth. Judges, when handing down judgments, enjoy a ‘relative sovereignty’, being always already inscribed into the institutional imperatives of the juridical, on one hand, and ideological influences, on the other, but at the same time called upon to decide in the terrain of the undecidable and contingent (after all, law does not ‘apply itself’ on its own). Indeed the determinacy of legal decisions is only relative: in many cases judges can, by performing a sufficient amount of legal interpretive work, reach a conclusion which will be different from the prima facie interpretation. The collective conflicts of a various nature (economic, ideological, socio-political), once they are juridified, become the object of judicial decisions which, in light of Mouffe’s theory, can be seen as temporary hegemonic fixations. The goal of critical legal scholarship is to destabilise such hegemonies in the name of justice. This can be done not only through an external critique of the law, but also through an internal one. The methodological approach advanced in the latter part of the paper emphasises the need for a critique of judicial decisions based on the consideration of all possible alternative decisions a court could have reached, and their evaluation in the light of conflicting interests and ideologies.},

Several empirical observations are consistent with this view, which are examined through a network analysis of European Court of Human Rights ({ECtHR}) citations. First, the Court cites precedent based on the legal issues in the case, not the country of origin. Second, the Court is more careful to embed judgements in its existing case law when the expected value of persuading domestic judges is highest.

Instead, we deploy a more appropriate methodology: semiparametric matching, which follows from a formal framework for causal inference. Applying matching methods to 13 areas of law, we observe consistent gender effects in only one—sex discrimination. For these disputes, the probability of a judge deciding in favor of the party alleging discrimination decreases by about 10 percentage points when the judge is a male. Likewise, when a woman serves on a panel with men, the men are significantly more likely to rule in favor of the rights litigant. These results are consistent with an informational account of gendered judging and are inconsistent with several others.},

            A key influence on governance and regulation is the ideology of individual decisionmakers. However, certain branches of government – such as courts – while wielding wide ranging regulatory powers, are expected to do so with no attitudinal influence. We posit a dynamic response model to investigate attitudinal behavior in different national courts. Our ideological scores are estimated based on probability models that formalize the assumption that judicial decisions consist of ideological, strategic, and jurisprudential components. The Dynamic Comparative Attitudinal Measure estimates the attitudinal decisionmaking on the institution as a whole. Additionally, we estimate Ideological Ideal Point Preference for individual justices. Empirical results with original data for political and religious rights rulings in the Supreme Courts of the United States, Canada, India, the Philippines, and Israel corroborate the measures' validity. Future studies can utilize Ideological Ideal Point Preference and the Dynamic Comparative Attitudinal Measure to cover additional courts, legal spheres, and time frames, and to estimate government deference.},

First, we examine whether clerks tend to share the liberal ideology of other lawyers or the more conservative ideology associated with federal judges and find that clerks tend to be disproportionately liberal. Second, we investigate how the ideologies of clerks compares to the ideologies of lawyers and find that liberal lawyers are more likely to have clerked than conservatives. Third, we assess whether the ideologies of clerks differs based on the level of clerkship and find that the liberal skew becomes less pronounced as the prestige of the clerkship increases. Fourth, we analyze the relationship between ideology and the hiring of clerks and find that the ideology of judges is strongly correlated with the ideology of their clerks.},

	shorttitle = {Sorcerers' Apprentices},
	abstract = {Law clerks have been a permanent fixture in the halls of the United States Supreme Court from its founding, but the relationship between clerks and their justices has generally been cloaked in secrecy. While the role of the justice is both public and formal, particularly in terms of the decisions a justice makes and the power that he or she can wield in the American political system, the clerk has historically operated behind closed doors. Do clerks make actual decisions that they impart to justices, or are they only research assistants that carry out the instructions of the decision makers—the justices?Based on Supreme Court archives, the personal papers of justices and other figures at the Supreme Court, and interviews and written surveys with 150 former clerks, Sorcerers’ Apprentices is a rare behind-the-scenes look at the life of a law clerk, and how it has evolved since its nineteenth-century beginnings. Artemus Ward and David L. Weiden reveal that throughout history, clerks have not only written briefs, but made significant decisions about cases that are often unseen by those outside of justices' chambers. Should clerks have this power, they ask, and, equally important, what does this tell us about the relationship between the Supreme Court’s accountability to and relationship with the American public?Sorcerers’ Apprentices not only sheds light on the little-known role of the clerk but offers provocative suggestions for reforming the institution of the Supreme Court clerk. Anyone that has worked as a law clerk, is considering clerking, or is interested in learning about what happens in the chambers of Supreme Court justices will want to read this engaging and comprehensive examination of how the role of the law clerk has evolved over its long history.},

Until recently, the unavailability of consistent information on both the clerks' recommendations and the justices' case selection votes precluded any empirical analysis. This study uses information gathered from the justices' private papers to compare the recommendations of Chief Justice Vinson's clerks with the certiorari votes cast by the justices during the Vinson era. The analyses of these recommendations and votes show that Vinson's clerks were trying to anticipate the chief justice's votes but that they displayed a liberal orientation during the first part of Vinson's tenure. During the second part of the Vinson era, when the Court had a more conservative membership, there is no indication of a liberal orientation in the clerks' recommendations.},

Tuto otázku nejprve zasazuje do kontextu obecné teorie senátního rozhodování a následně empiricky zkoumá v rozhodnutích Ústavního soudu. Na teoretické úrovni jsou formulovány tři základní účely senátního rozhodování: posílení legitimity rozhodnutí, eliminace chyb a dosažení promyšlenějšího rozhodnutí, a čtyři modely senátního rozhodování: konfliktní senát, strategický senát, kolegiální senát a formální senát.

            Examining the practices of i) the selection of judges, ii) panel composition and case assignment, and iii) judicial off-bench activities, the article argues that some Czech judges, most often court presidents and apex court judges, use informal judicial institutions as tools to increase their influence on judicial administration and the decision-making of courts. As a result, these judges have far greater influence than the formal account of their roles might suggest. The article explores the context which facilitated the informal rise of these “Superjudges”, asserting that the key factors were institutionally independent judiciaries with individually dependent judges, the absence of a shared understanding of fundamental constitutional concepts, and the underperformance of Czech legal academia. The article then contends that while Superjudges may contribute to an informed, effective, and politically independent functioning of the judiciary, they also risk eroding important divisions of power which, in turn, might compromise the integrity of the judicial process, undermine the authority of courts, and disconnect the content of the law from the general interest.},
